This extension adds a button to toolbar which, when clicked, will open the current link one of sci-hub's mirrors. You can also right click on a link and click 'Download PDF' which will attempt to download the PDF automatically for you. It is possible to change which mirror is used by the extension by right clicking on the toolbar icon, selecting "Manage extension" and opening "Options" in the page. Currently there are only 4 mirrors, I may add more if people need it.

### To do

- Support Chromium based browsers
- Better error handling

### Credits

 - The icon is made by <a href='https://www.flaticon.com/authors/umeicon'>Umeicon</a> from <a>www.flaticon.com</a>.
