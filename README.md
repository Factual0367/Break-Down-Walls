<h1 align='center'>Break Down Walls</h1>

 This is a Firefox extension. It adds a button to toolbar which, when clicked, will open the current link one of sci-hub's mirrors. It is possible to change which mirror is used by the extension by right clicking on the toolbar icon, selecting "Manage extension" and opening "Options" in the page. Currently there are only 4 mirrors, I may add more.

 ### To do

 - Support Chromium based browsers
 - Better error handling

 ## Credits

 - The icon is made by <a href='https://www.flaticon.com/authors/umeicon'>Umeicon</a> from <a href='https://www.flaticon.com'>www.flaticon.com</a>.
